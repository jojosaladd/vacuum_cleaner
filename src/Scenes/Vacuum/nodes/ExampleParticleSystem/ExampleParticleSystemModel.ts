     * TrashBag system model for using instanced particles
     * "Instanced" graphics are ones where the same geometry is rendered many times, possibly with minor variations (e.g., in position and color). Each render of the object is an "instance". This is handled as a special case so that the program can share common data across the different instances, which helps scale up to a larger number of instances more efficiently. This makes it great for something like a particle system, where you have many copies of the same geometry.
     * Note that with instanced graphics, you need to specify the number of instances you plan to use up front so that we can allocate resources on the GPU to store whatever attributes vary between instances. This means that instead of creating new particles and destroying old ones as the application progresses, you will create a fixed budget of particles up front and simply hide any particles you aren't using. Then, when you want to "create" a new particle, you take one of the hidden particles, set its attributed, and un-hide it.

     * We often want to know the current time when a particle is emitted. You may also consider writing a third function called something like `launchParticle` that finds a particle to recycle and explicitly sets a condition that will lead to it being emitted the next time `timeUpdate` is called. This will let you trigger the emission of a particle from a controller interaction (e.g., keyboard or mouse event), which runs asynchronously with your model.
